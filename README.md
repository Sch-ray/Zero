Welcome here, and thank you all for your support. This is the public directory of the Zero project, where some files will be gradually open-sourced.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Statement: If you like the FlipperZero project and have sufficient financial ability, please purchase the original device through official channels. Building such a strong community is not easy, and we appreciate that they have open-sourced a large amount of materials. My device is not intended for counterfeiting or piracy. It includes targeted modifications and uses a completely new exterior design for clear distinction. The enclosure is fully incompatible with the original device. The purpose is to create a more affordable device and promote better development of the project.

> Additional statement: The device is intended only for legal technical learning and lawful analysis and testing by professionals (you should know what you are doing).

The shell model files are now available. You can print a more attractive ⭐ and personalized 😎 enclosure for yourself!
